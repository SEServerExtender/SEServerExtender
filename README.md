====================

Space Engineers Server Extender and Community Modding API

The Community Modding API is a framework for performing low-level modifications to the game that aren't necessarily possible with the KSH mod API.

SEServerExtender is a server wrapper that gives you significantly enhanced administrative capabilities both in-game and outside the game. 

Versions follow Space Engineers, indicating which version of SE each version of SEServerExtender or the Modding API supports.
For example, v1.72.08.146 supports SE version 1.72.08.
